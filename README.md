# Measuring MBTA Transit Sheds with Isochrones

This app visualizes the areas accessible via public transit in Greater Boston within defined time periods (15 min, 30 min, 45 min, and 60 min). It runs on a local instance of Open Trip Planner. Set up your own per the instructions on the MBTA's Open Trip Planner repository: https://github.com/mbta/OpenTripPlanner.

This app was adapted from the method outlined here: https://xang1234.github.io/isochrone/
